                    <h2 style="padding-bottom:5%; font-size:24pt;"><i>48 Years Ago...</i></h2>
                    <p>48 Years ago, on April 1st, 1968, Mike Herr joined the US Postal Office. 
                    <p>40 Years ago, he became Penn State's very own Mailman, on the very day he was offered the job.</p>
                    <p>In his time at Penn State, Mike the Mailman has been a shining example of what it means to be a Penn Stater - a personifation of our campus.</p>

                    <p>As he puts it, <i>“I think Penn State is the best place. Working here with so many people from different walks of life, all here trying to make it a better place, and that's what I'm trying to do."</i></p>
                    <br>
                    <h2 style="padding-bottom:5%; font-size:24pt;"><i>From All Walks Of Life...</i></h2>

                    <p>Mike has made appearances for events and intiatives from all parts of campus, with a smile and a sharp pair of shoes.</p>

                    <p>From Homecoming parades, to his very own bar tour, to the very first THON Mail Call in 1990, Mike has seen Penn State in many different lights. 
                    <br>
                    <p>But it's been from his office in the basement of McAllister Building that he's been able to make the biggest impact.</p>
                    <p><i>“To me, the best part has been all of the people who have walked into my office here at University Park, from the one-time visits from prospective future students to the regulars that have formed friendships with my family and I. To me, those are the best mementos.”</i></p>
                    <br />
                    <h2 style="padding-bottom:5%; font-size:24pt;"><i>It's not a goodbye...</i></h2>
                    
                    <p>To celebrate Mike’s career, <i>we</i> will be turning the tables and collecting stories, pictures, and memories for Mike’s final mail call. </p>

<p><strong>We will be collecting mail from 3/14 - 3/30 at the mailbox on the Information Desk in the HUB.</strong></p>
                    
<p>If you've ever had the chance to meet Mike, or he's brightened your day somehow, please feel free to drop off a letter. </p>
                    
<p>As Mike as shown us over the years: <i>small actions go a long way.</i> Here's our opportunity to pay the postage.</p>
                    
<p>On April 1st at 11:30 AM, we'll be giving Mike some mail of his own to read into his retirement.</p>
                    
<p><i><strong>From the entire student body, Mike, thank you so much for all you've done.</strong></i></p>
